<h1><img align="center" height="35" src="./public/images/logo.png"> QuizUp</h1>

Preparation for any exam is incomplete without mock tests and quizzes.
<br/>
That is why we will create a gamified platform for people who are preparing for various government exams/ IT exams.
<br/>
It will enable them to give mock tests and skill based quizzes in a fun and interactive way while gaining tips for areas of improvement.
<br/>
They will feel like playing a game while testing their skills.
